.TH GIMPPRINT\-RESOLUTIONS 7 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GIMPPRINT_VERSION@" "Gimp-Print Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
gimpprint\-resolutions \- Gimp-Print print resolutions
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gimp-Print supports many different resolutions, which are printer type
specific.  The option names are case sensitive.  Not all resolutions are
supported on all printers.
.SH PRINT RESOLUTONS
.SS Epson Stylus printers
Within each specified resolution, the quality is generally listed from worst to
best (and generally higher quality means lower speed).  For example, \fI360 DPI
Unidirectional\fP is usually better than \fI360 DPI\fP.  Characteristics of
specific models and individual printers may affect the orderings to some
degree; on many printers, with certain papers, unidirectional printing will
improve quality substantially more than using an otherwise better quality
printing mode.
.PP
The difference between different quality settings lies in the number
of passes made over each line.  "High" and "Highest" quality settings
perform more passes, printing fewer dots with each pass over the same
line and using different nozzles for each pass.  This reduces banding
effects, but requires more time.
.PP
\fIMicroweave\fP modes use algorithms within the printer to generate the
sequence of rows printed.  These algorithms generally only work well at low
printing resolutions.  Many printers do not support this kind of printing at
resolutions of 720 DPI and above, and some printers that do actually print just
one row (using just one nozzle per color) at a time.  While this particular use
will produce extremely high quality (no banding whatsoever, normally), it is
extremely slow and may eventually damage the print head due to ink pooling.
All printers that we are aware of have no such trouble at 360 DPI.
.PP
We generally recommend the following resolutions for the following
purposes:

Standard quality output on plain paper (output will be solidly black); draft

High quality output on plain paper; standard output on good
quality inkjet paper.
T}
720	T{
Maximum quality on plain paper; high quality on good inkjet paper; proofs on
photo-quality paper.  On many printers, there will be little difference between
this and 720x360 on plain paper.
T}
1440x720	T{
High quality on photo paper; use 1440x720 Highest Quality to reduce
microbanding if needed.  While this will work on plain paper, it usually offers
little improvement over 720 DPI.
T}
2880x720	T{
Highest quality on photo paper.  While this may yield slightly improved
quality, it will generally not be markedly superior to 1440x720 Highest
Quality, except on the Stylus Color 980 and Stylus C70 and C80, where it may
yield a noticeable improvement.  It takes as long to print as 1440x720 highest
quality, but twice as long to generate the output.
T}
1440x1440	T{
An unsupported mode that offers higher quality than 2880x720 for certain types
of images on very high quality paper.  It does not appear to offer any
advantage on smooth tones, but fine detail (particularly vertical, and to a
lesser extent near-horizontal) it shows noticeable improvement.  It takes as
long to print as 2880x720.  1440x1440 highest quality takes twice as long to
print.
T}
2880x1440	T{
An unsupported mode that may offer higher quality than 2880x720 for certain
types of images on very high quality paper.  Experiments conducted thus far
demonstrate little if any improvement over 1440x1440.  It takes twice as long
to print as 2880x720 or 1440x1440, and as long to print as 1440x1440 highest
quality.

.IP 4
Works on older printers with dot spacing of 1/120 inch.  This includes the
Stylus Color Pro, Pro XL, 400, and 500.

.IP 7
Works on all printers that do support variable drop sizes.  This includes all

.IP 8
Recommended only on processors slower than 200 MHz, the system is heavily
loaded with a faster processor, or if problems are experienced at 720x360.
.IP 9
Works on all supported printers except for Stylus Color, Stylus Color Pro,
Stylus Color Pro XL, Stylus Color 1500, 1520, and 3000.
.IP 10
On printers that do not support variable drop size (see note (4)), this will
print as fast as 360 DPI, and faster than 360 DPI High Quality.  It will take
twice as long to generate output, which may be important on a heavily loaded
system or a processor slower than 200 MHz.
.IP 11
Works on some older printers, including the Stylus Color, Stylus Color 400,
500, 600, 800, 850, 1500, 1520, and 3000, Stylus Color Pro, and Stylus Color
Pro XL.  Not recommended except for the Stylus Color, Stylus Color 1500, 1520,
and 3000.
.IP 12
Works on Stylus Color 600, 800, 850, 1520, and 3000.  Not recommended unless
other 1440x720 modes do not work.
.IP 13
Works on all printers that support 1440x720 DPI.  This includes all supported
printers except for the Stylus Color, Stylus Color Pro, Pro XL, 400, 440, 460,
480, 500, and 1500, and Stylus Photo.  In addition, this may not work correctly
on Stylus Color 1520 and Stylus Color 3000.
.IP 14

such printers.
.IP 17
These resolutions print at particularly high speed on the Epson Stylus Photo
950, 960, 2100, and 2200 when printing in Four Color Standard or Three Color
Composite modes, or when printing in monochrome or grayscale with any ink type
other than Two Level Grayscale, Seven Color Photo, or Quadtone.
