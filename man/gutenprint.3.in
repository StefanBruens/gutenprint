.SH NAME
\fBgutenprint\fR \- High quality raster image printing library

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgutenprint\fR library routines give programmers an interface to print

provide printing quality for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary
vendor-supplied drivers in many cases, and can be used for many of the most
demanding printing tasks.
