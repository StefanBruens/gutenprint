 * Abstract data type for interfacing with the image creation program

 * The progress_init(), note_progress(), and progress_conclude() members
 * are used to enable the image layer to deliver notification of
 * progress to the user.  It is likely that these functions will be
 * dropped in the future, and if desired must be implemented in
 * get_row().
 *
 * get_appname() should return the name of the application.  This is
 * embedded in the output by some drivers.
 *
 * width() and height() return the dimensions of the image in pixels.
 *
 * bpp(), or bytes per pixel, is used in combination with the output type
 * and presence of a color map, if supplied, to determine the format
 * of the input:
 *
 * Output_type is OUTPUT_COLOR, or OUTPUT_GRAY:
 *
 *    bpp           No color map                Color map present
 *     1            grayscale                   indexed color (256 colors)
 *     2            grayscale w/alpha           indexed color w/alpha
 *     3            RGB                         N/A
 *     4            N/A                         RGB w/alpha (RGBA)
 *
 * Output_type is OUTPUT_CMYK:
 *
 *    bpp           No color map                Color map present
 *     4            8 bits/plane CMYK           N/A
 *     8            16 bits/plane CMYK          N/A
 *
 * Output type is OUTPUT_RAW_PRINTER:
 *
 *    If the printer supports OUTPUT_RAW_PRINTER, the bpp value should be
 *    2 x the number of channels desired to print (the precise modes
 *    available are printer-dependent).  Each plane is therefore 2 bytes
 *    (16 bits) deep.
 *
 * init() is used to perform any initialization required by the image
 * layer for the image.  It will be called once per image.  reset() is
 * called to reset the image to the beginning.  It may (in principle)
 * be called multiple times if a page is being printed more than once.
 * The reset() call may be removed in the future.
 *
 * get_row() transfers the data from the image to the gimp-print
 * library.  It is called from the driver layer.  It should copy WIDTH
 * (as returned by the width() member) pixels of data into the data
 * buffer.  It normally returns STP_IMAGE_STATUS_OK; if something goes wrong,
 * or the application wishes to stop producing any further output
 * (e. g. because the user cancelled the print job), it should return
 * STP_IMAGE_STATUS_ABORT.  This will cause the driver to flush any remaining
 * data to the output.  It will always request rows in monotonically
 * ascending order, but it may skip rows (if, for example, the
 * resolution of the input is higher than the resolution of the
 * output).
