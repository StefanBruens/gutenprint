Welcome to Gutenprint 5.0.0!  Please read these notes carefully.

================================================================

I) INTRODUCTION

    This is Gutenprint version 5.0.0, the first stable release of
    Gutenprint 5.0.  Gutenprint, formerly named Gimp-Print, is a suite
    of printer drivers that may be used with most common UNIX print
    spooling systems, including CUPS, lpr, LPRng, or others.  These
    drivers provide high quality printing for UNIX (including
    Macintosh OS X 10.2 and newer) and Linux systems in many cases
    equal to or better than proprietary vendor-supplied drivers, and
    can be used for many of the most demanding printing tasks.  A
    complete list of supported printers may be found in the NEWS file.
    Gutenprint also includes an enhanced print plug-in for the GIMP
    image editor, replacing the Gimp-Print 4.2-based plugin supplied
    with GIMP 1.2, 2.0, and 2.2, and offering an alternative with
    additional capabilities to the GtkPrint-based plugin supplied with
    GIMP 2.4 and beyond.

    Gutenprint has been renamed in order to clearly distinguish it
    from the GIMP.  While this package started out as the Print plugin
    for the GIMP, it has expanded into a collection of general purpose
    printer drivers, and the enhanced Print plugin for the GIMP is now
    only a small part of the package.  Furthermore, the name
    Gutenprint recognizes Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the
    movable type printing press.  Finally, the word "guten" means
    "good" in German.

    Please read this README, and the NEWS file carefully!  Many things
    have changed from previous releases.  The package is quite
    different in many ways from Gimp-Print 4.2, and you should read
    these instructions carefully.  In addition, the NEWS file contains
    specific software requirements.

    Gutenprint supports only the printer part of multi-function
    devices (devices that typically include scanning, copying, and fax
    capabilities).

    We recommend that all users who wish to use this package for
    general purpose printing use either CUPS or, if they use another
    printing system or no spooler at all, use Foomatic with the
    Ghostscript driver (both described below), rather than integrating
    the Ghostscript driver with self-made scripts or even manually
    typing in Ghostscript command lines.  It is much simpler to manage
    with CUPS or Foomatic and its PPDs.  CUPS provides an excellent
    web-based interface for easy printer administration, and all
    CUPS-enabled applications (OpenOffice.org, all KDE apps, etc.) and
    printing dialogs (kprinter, xpp, etc.) show all the options in
    easy to use GUIs.  Please visit http://www.cups.org/ for
    information on downloading and installing CUPS.


================================================================

II) INSTALLATION

    This section is provided for people installing the package from
    source.  If you are installing from a pre-compiled package (such
    as the Macintosh OS X package, or a package provided by your
    distribution vendor), you may skip this section.

    Installing packages from source requires some level of system
    administration skills along with superuser privileges.  Superuser
    privilege allows you to perform actions that may be damaging to
    your system.  If you are not comfortable with the material
    discussed here and in the release notes, we recommend that you not
    attempt to install this package from source.

    Before beginning, please read the release notes carefully for any
    updates.

----------------

A) OVERVIEW

    Gutenprint includes the following primary components:

      - The core driver library (required for everything else)
      - A CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) driver
      - An enhanced Print plug-in for the GIMP
      - Support for the Foomatic spooler configuration system
      - A Ghostscript driver using the IJS plugin facility
      - A command-line utility to administer and maintain Epson
        printers

    This package requires the use of GNU Make to compile.  On systems
    with both GNU make and another make installed, GNU make may be
    named `gmake' or `gnumake'.  BSD users in particular must take
    care to use 'gmake'.

    The general procedure to build Gutenprint is as follows:

    ./configure [options]
    make
    make install

    The "configure" script, which must be run before doing anything
    else, controls which of these components are built along with any
    options desired.  This script determines what software is
    installed on your system and what components will be compatible
    with it, and prepares the package to be built and installed.  If
    the script emits any warnings or errors, please be certain that
    you understand them before proceeding.

    After the configure script has completed its work, it will print
    a summary of its choices.  Please ensure that it is correct before
    proceeding.  The summary looks like this:

	================================================================


    The CUPS, GIMP, Foomatic, and Ghostscript components require that
    the appropriate packages be installed on your system.  Many
    distribution vendors separate packages into runtime and
    development packages.  The development packages are required in
    order to successfully compile Gutenprint.  In many cases the
    configure script cannot detect whether these development packages
    are installed, in which case you will get an error during
    compilation.

----------------

B) CORE DRIVER LIBRARY

    The core driver library, which is always built, contains all of
    the printer drivers comprising the Gutenprint package.  When the
    package is built, it consists of a core library (libgutenprint), a
    set of XML files, and depending upon the options selected,
    additional libraries containing the drivers for each family of
    printers.

    By default dynamically loadable modules (plug-ins) will be built
    for the family drivers, and loaded at run-time if your operating
    system supports it.  If you experience problems,
    --with-modules=dlopen or --with-modules=ltdl may be used to select
    the module loading method (dlopen is the default, but GNU libltdl
    is more portable), or --with-modules=static or --without-modules
    disables them.  If you wish to compile Gutenprint entirely
    statically (with no use of shared libraries), you may use the
    option --disable-shared.

    NOTES TO PACKAGERS: 

    * You may wish to create a development package containing header
      files and linkable libraries separate from the runtime package.
      There are a few third party applications that link against
      Gutenprint.

    * Gutenprint permits installation of Gimp-Print 4.2 alongside
      Gutenprint 5.0, and in the future will permit concurrent
      installation of different stable versions of Gutenprint with
      different minor version numbers.  Gutenprint uses the old-style
      kernel numbering system, whereby even numbered minor versions
      are stable (4.2, 5.0, 5.2) and odd numbered minor versions are
      development (4.3, 5.1).  Therefore, you should consider allowing
      Gutenprint 5.0 and Gimp-Print 4.2 to be installed concurrently.


----------------

B) CUPS

    Gutenprint may be used as a driver under CUPS (Common UNIX
    Printing System), if your system uses that spooler.  Full
    description of CUPS is beyond the scope of this README file; full
    information may be found at http://www.cups.org.  Gutenprint 5.0
    requires CUPS 1.1.9 or higher.  We recommend use of 1.1.15 or
    above; that release of CUPS fixes some important bugs.  Gutenprint
    supports CUPS 1.2, but at this time does not take advantage of the
    new features of that release.

    Gutenprint will normally detect the presence of CUPS on your
    system and will attempt to build the CUPS driver if it finds CUPS
    installed.  If your distribution separates the CUPS installation
    into development and runtime packages, you must install the CUPS
    development package.  You may need to install other development
    packages depending upon how your distribution has built CUPS.

    Installing the CUPS driver for Gutenprint 5.0 will not interfere
    with your ability to continue using the Gimp-Print 4.2 CUPS
    driver.

    The Gutenprint CUPS driver consists of the following components:

    * The core Gutenprint CUPS driver, rastertogutenprint.5.0.  This
      is a CUPS filter that converts CUPS raster data into
      printer-specific data.  This is most commonly installed in
      /usr/lib/cups/filter.

    * Back ends for driving Canon and Epson printers, named "canon"
      and "epson".  These provide the ability to get information from
      the printer for CUPS to use, and are normally installed in
      /usr/lib/cups/backend.  Additional utilities to send certain
      commands to these printers are installed as commandtocanon and
      commandtoepson; they are installed in /usr/lib/cups/filter.

    * One or more sets of PPD files describing all of the printers
      supported by Gutenprint.  These are normally installed in
      /usr/share/cups/model/gutenprint.  These PPD files can only be
      used by the precise version of Gutenprint that they were built
      with; for example, it is not possible to use PPD files from
      Gutenprint 5.0.0 with Gutenprint 5.0.1.

    * A utility to update PPD files from an earlier release of
      Gutenprint, cups-genppdupdate.5.0.  This utility may be used to
      update PPD files generated by earlier versions of Gutenprint
      starting from 4.3.21.  This is normally installed in /usr/sbin.
      This utility cannot update PPD files from Gimp-Print 4.2.

    * A utility to generate PPD files, cups-genppd.5.0.  Normally this
      is only required when the package is built.

    * A utility to permit additional color calibration for
      Gutenprint-supported printers, cups-calibrate.  This is normally
      installed in /usr/bin.

    WARNING: With certain versions of CUPS and in certain non-default
	configurations, if a new version of Gutenprint is installed
	over an existing version genppd will create PPD files based on
	the older version of Gutenprint rather than the newer version.
	This will happen if all of the following are true:

	i) The cups-config provided by the CUPS driver adds
	   -Wl,rpath=/usr/lib. This is done by some versions of CUPS
	   reportedly because in some cases the runtime linker does
	   not pick up libraries out of /usr/lib.  This can be checked
	   by running

	   cups-config --libs --ldflags

	   and inspecting the output for any mention of "rpath",
	   "RPATH", "RUN_PATH", or the like.  This is controlled by
	   the CUPS installation on your system.

	ii) There is presently a version of Gutenprint installed in
	   /usr (--prefix=/usr) rather than /usr/local or the like.
	   The default location of Gutenprint installation is in
	   /usr/local, but system vendors typically install Gutenprint
	   in /usr.

	iii) Gutenprint is built dynamically only (--disable-static or
	   --disable-static-genppd).  This is not a default, and
	   requires the explicit --disable-static or
	   --disable-static-genppd on the Gutenprint "configure"
	   command line.  Therefore, if you build Gutenprint normally
	   you should not be vulnerable to this problem.

	Note that in general if you install CUPS into a non-standard
	location, and install Gutenprint into the same location, this
	problem can surface.  For example, if you choose to install
	CUPS in /usr/local and Gutenprint in /usr/local you are
	vulnerable to this.  However, it is not standard practice to
	install CUPS anywhere but /usr.

	In this case, the run path embedded in the genppd executable
	points to the version of Gutenprint installed in /usr/lib.
	This run path overrides any attempt by libtool to look in the
	build directory.  The result is that cups-genppd and
	rastertogutenprint are run against the older version of
	Gutenprint.  If the new version contains additional features
	(more printers, changes to printer options, etc.) they will
	not be available.

	This bug is difficult to detect in a normal build.  It
	normally does not cause an error to happen during build unless
	there is an API change from the version installed and the
	version being built; the only failure is frequently that some
	PPD files may not be built or may be built with missing
	options.  Due to the PPD version checking introduced in this
	release, the behavior might manifest itself as a runtime
	error.  It is also possible that there will be no error at all
	other than the older version of Gutenprint being used, with
	the result that new features and bug fixes are not available.

	If you wish to use only shared libraries, do not wish to build
	static libraries at all, and are vulnerable to this issue
	(because cups-config --ldflags sets the run path), there are
	three workarounds available:

	i) Build and install Gutenprint into /usr (rather than
	   /usr/local) and then rebuild Gutenprint from scratch.  This
	   will install the correct libgutenprint.so in /usr/lib, and
	   in the rebuild genppd will be run against the correct
	   library.

	ii) Remove the old version of Gutenprint prior to building the
	   new version of Gutenprint.  The important files to remove
	   are anything named /usr/lib/libgutenprint*.

	iii) Edit cups-config to remove the reference to the run path.

    Following installation of the package with "make install", you
    must restart CUPS to permit CUPS to see the new PPD files.  The
    exact command to restart CUPS varies; it is typically something
    like /etc/init.d/cups, /etc/software/init.d/cups, /etc/rc.d/cups,
    /usr/sbin/rccups, or even /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups.  Your system may
    have a different way to restart the CUPS server.  OS X, for
    example, uses the following command:

    sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/PrintingServices/PrintingServices.sh restart
  
    You may optionally choose to update your existing PPD files using
    the command cups-genppdupdate.5.0, after which you should restart
    CUPS as described above.  We strongly recommend use of this update
    procedure.  This script will automatically update Gutenprint PPD
    files from earlier versions.  This script will only update PPD
    files from earlier versions of Gutenprint; it will not update
    Gimp-Print 4.2 PPD files.  However, you may install Gutenprint 5.0
    alongside Gimp-Print 4.2, and use both Gimp-Print 4.2 and
    Gutenprint 5.0 drivers concurrently in separate printer queues.
    Therefore, you need not convert a workflow based on Gimp-Print 4.2
    right away, but can gradually convert or even permanently use both
    drivers for different printer queues.

    The following options to configure are available for compiling the
    Gutenprint driver for CUPS:

    --disable-translated-cups-ppds

	By default, PPD files for all languages available in
	Gutenprint are created.  If this option is used, only the
	default (US-English) PPD files are created.  Distributors may
	wish to package up the PPD files separately for each language.

	Some systems may not build the translated PPD files correctly,
	in which case all of the PPD files will be in English.  If
	this is the case on your system, you should use
	--disable-translated-cups-ppds to avoid having many duplicate
	PPD files.

    --enable-simplified-cups-ppds

	Gutenprint 5.0 offers an option of creating simplified PPD
	files (containing only basic options and standard paper sizes)
	in addition to PPD files offering all available options
	(including all color correction options).  If this option is
	used, both the simplified and standard PPD files are created.
	If --enable-simplified-cups-ppds=only is specified, only the
	simplified PPD files are built.

    --disable-cups-level3-ppds

	By default, the Gutenprint PPD files are configured for
	PostScript Level 3.  If this option is used, Level 2 PPD files
	are created.  This may be useful if you are using a version of
	CUPS older than 1.1.15.  It is normally not necessary to use
	this explicitly, as the configure script detects the version
	of CUPS in use and selects the appropriate PostScript level
	automatically.

    --disable-cups-ppds-at-top-level

	Normally, the PPD files are placed in
	/usr/share/cups/model/gutenprint/5.0.  If this option is used,
	the PPD files are placed in /usr/share/cups/model.  There is
	normally no good reason to use this option.

    --disable-static-genppd

	Build genppd and rastertogutenprint dynamically linked rather
	than statically linked.  WARNING: Use of this option may lead
	to failure during build or installation, or incorrect
	installation.  It is *STRONGLY* recommended that you not use
	this option unless you are certain that you understand the
	problem and how to work around it.

    NOTES TO PACKAGERS: 

    * We recommend that your installation package run
      cups-genppdupdate.5.0 and restart CUPS as part of the
      installation process.

    * All files and directories with versioned names
      (e. g. cups-genppdupdate, rastertogutenprint, the PPD files) may
      be installed concurrently with other versions of Gimp-Print and
      Gutenprint as described above.  Other executables (such as the
      Canon and Epson back ends, and cups-calibrate) are not
      versioned, but are not linked against libgutenprint and do not
      have any other dependencies on Gutenprint.


----------------

C) FOOMATIC

    Foomatic is a printer meta-driver that can be used with any
    spooler (CUPS, lpd, LPRng, etc.) or even no spooler at all.  It
    uses XML data describing printer and driver capabilities in
    conjunction with Ghostscript to allow printing in any environment.
    Please visit http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html for more
    information.

    We normally recommend using the native CUPS driver described above
    if your system uses CUPS as its spooler.  However, some systems
    (many releases of Fedora Core, for example) use Foomatic as the
    repository for all printer information; the tools provided on
    those systems will not recognize the CUPS PPD files.  If your
    system uses Foomatic in this way, or does not use CUPS, you should
    use Foomatic to manage your printers.

    The Gutenprint driver for Foomatic requires Foomatic 2.0 or
    higher; Foomatic 3.0 or above is highly recommended.  It also
    requires GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or newer, AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 or
    newer, or ESP Ghostscript 7.05 or newer for IJS support.

    The Foomatic support in Gutenprint consists of a data generator
    and an IJS-based Ghostscript driver.  It is possible to use the
    Ghostscript driver without Foomatic, but the Gutenprint options
    are complex and subject to change without notice.  Older printer
    configuration tools such as apsfilter and magicfilter do not
    provide a convenient interface to the driver's capabilities.
    Therefore, we no longer provide documentation on direct use of the
    Ghostscript driver without the Foomatic front end.

    The Ghostscript driver in Gutenprint 5.0 is based on the IJS
    protocol.  IJS is a protocol originally developed by
    Hewlett-Packard to allow new drivers to be used with Ghostscript
    without having to be compiled into Ghostscript.  As this driver
    runs in a separate process, and IJS is licensed in a way
    compatible with the GPL, this driver may be used with AFPL
    Ghostscript if desired.  We no longer offer the legacy "stp"
    driver provided in Gimp-Print 4.2.  This driver was difficult to
    maintain and required a complex procedure to integrate with
    Ghostscript.

    Gutenprint 5.0 offers two Foomatic drivers, one supporting the
    full range of options and the other supporting simplified options,
    as describe above under CUPS.  The full-featured driver is named
    "gutenprint-ijs.5.0"; the simplified driver is named
    "gutenprint-ijs-simplified.5.0".  This allows Gutenprint 5.0 to
    coexist with Gimp-Print 4.2; both drivers may be installed and
    used (on separate printer queues, of course) on the same system.

    Normally, the Gutenprint configure script will automatically
    detect the presence of Foomatic and Ghostscript on your system.
    In some cases, you may have to install a Ghostscript development
    package that may be named gs-devel, ghostscript-library, or the
    like for the IJS capability.

    The Foomatic driver will not allow use of PPD files created from
    Foomatic data from a different version of Gutenprint.  This
    ensures that the PPD files accurately match the driver in use.
    However, there is no automatic upgrade tool provided for the
    Foomatic driver, unlike the CUPS driver.  Therefore, all queues
    using a Gutenprint driver must be updated manually, using either
    tools provided by your distribution or the Foomatic tool
    "foomatic-ppdfile".

    NOTES TO PACKAGERS: 

    * We recommend packaging the IJS driver
      (/usr/bin/ijsgutenprint.5.0) and its man page
      (/usr/man/man1/ijsgutenprint.1.gz) together with the Foomatic
      data.

    * The IJS driver and the Foomatic data kit and PPD files are
      versioned, and hence you should consider permitting multiple
      versions to be installed concurrently.  The man page
      (/usr/man/man1/ijsgutenprint.1.gz) is not versioned.


----------------

D) THE GIMP

    Gutenprint may be used with an enhanced Print plug-in for the
    GIMP, providing the ability to print images.  If you wish to do
    so, you must use the GIMP 1.2.3 or above on the 1.2 line, or any
    GIMP 2.x release (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, etc.)  Please read the release
    notes in addition to this README, as there have been some changes
    in procedure since Gimp-Print 4.2 if you are using certain
    versions of the GIMP.

    The enhanced Print plugin for the GIMP replaces the Gimp-Print
    4.2-based plugin provided with the GIMP 2.0 and 2.2.  As of the
    GIMP 2.4, the GIMP team provides a new Print plugin based on the
    GtkPrint framework.  This plugin provides standard printing
    capabilities, but does not provide all of the new Gutenprint 5.0
    features.  Therefore, the enhanced Print plugin for the GIMP
    distributed with Gutenprint does not replace that plugin, but is
    installed alongside that plugin.

    If your system separates development packages from runtime
    packages, you will typically have to install development packages
    for the GIMP itself, in addition to GTK and glib.  With the GIMP
    2.x and GTK 2.x, additional packages may be required.

    Normally, the Gutenprint configure script detects which version,
    if any, of the GIMP is installed and builds an appropriate plugin.
    If the configure script does not detect it properly, you may need
    to specify --with-gimp or --with-gimp2.  However, it's more likely
    that you need to install appropriate development packages.

    Normally Gutenprint installs the GIMP Print plugin in your system
    plug-in directory.  If you wish to install it in your personal
    plugin directory, you may use

    ./configure --enable-user-install

    It is not possible for Gimp-Print 4.2 and Gutenprint 5.0 (or any
    future release) to coexist in the same installation of the GIMP.
    The Gutenprint 5.0-based plugin can read settings from previous
    versions of Gimp-Print, but the configuration file format in
    Gutenprint 5.0 cannot be read by older versions of Gimp-Print.

    The GIMP 1.2 will not be supported in Gutenprint 5.1 and beyond.
    However, all Gutenprint 5.0 releases will support the GIMP 1.2.

    The GIMP 2.x plugin may eventually be migrated to the GIMP project
    for a future GIMP release and be removed from the Gutenprint
    distribution.

    NOTE TO PACKAGERS:

    * The GIMP plugin, unlike the core library and the Foomatic and
      CUPS drivers, may not be installed concurrently with other
      versions.  For example, you may not install both the Gimp-Print
      4.2 and the Gutenprint 5.0 version of the Print plugin, as they
      use different configuration file formats.

E) ESCPUTIL

    "escputil" is a command line utility for administering Epson
    inkjet printers.  It performs head alignment, retrieval of ink
    levels and status information, printing of test patterns, etc.  It
    is built and installed by default; if you don't want it, you may
    use --without-escputil when configuring.

    escputil uses the readline package for interactive commands
    (currently only head alignment falls into this category).  Linking
    against libreadline sometimes requires linking against other
    packages.  Gutenprint attempts to determine the correct packages
    to link against; the exact sequence is described in the release
    notes.  If you do not wish to use readline, you may use
    --without-readline.

    Unlike the case in Gimp-Print 4.2, this utility is not standalone;
    it requires the installation of the core Gutenprint package to
    function.  This allows it to support new printers without
    modification.


----------------

F) OTHER PACKAGES

    Gutenprint includes a few other packages: a test pattern generator
    and a test suite.  If you wish to compile these, you may use
    --enable-test and/or --enable-testpattern.

    The test pattern generator permits generating various test
    patterns; it can also be used to print images in 16-bit depth and
    specifying all ink channels separately.  The image format is not
    documented outside of the code itself; this is not a general
    purpose image printing tool.  It is used as part of the regression
    test suite.

    To run the test suite, you must configure in both the tests and
    the test pattern generator and run "make check".  The test suite
    takes about 12 hours to run, depending upon the speed of the
    processor.

    The tests currently cover the following areas:

    1) Regression test each printer with default settings, using each
       dither algorithm.

    2) Regression test each input and output type in 8 and 16 bit, in
       grayscale and color, on the Epson Stylus Photo R800 (which has
       additional red and blue inks that use additional code paths).

    3) Regression test each resolution and ink type in color and black
       and white on each printer.

    4) Regression test CUPS PPD files for correctness, using the
       "cupstestppd" command provided with CUPS.  This test fails if
       there are any errors in relaxed mode; it allows failures in
       strict mode but gives a warning.

    5) Test functionality of the new curve data type.

    6) Regression test each dither algorithm with different types of
       inputs and drop sizes.

    7) Regression and functional test of the weave (interleave) code.
       This test is the most time-consuming of the entire suite, as it
       tests every weave pattern used by every printer in every mode
       (currently about 700,000 cases).

    Four of the tests in the suite can be run individually under
    valgrind to check correctness of memory use.  These are:

    src/testpattern/run-testpattern
    src/testpattern/run-testpattern-1
    src/testpattern/run-testpattern-2
    test/run-testdither

    The following options can be passed to each of these tests:

    -v		  Run valgrind normally, displaying errors and memory
		  leaks.
    -v -v	  Run valgrind with enhanced leak resolution, and show
		  reachable memory in addition to memory leaks.
    -v -v -v	  Run valgrind with enhanced leak resolution, show
		  reachable memory in addition to memory leaks, and
		  display all errors (no limit on errors displayed).
    -c		  Use cachegrind for performance profiling (cannot be
		  used in combination with other -v options).

    If you run valgrind with run-testpattern-2, we recommend use of
    the "-s" option to skip testing printers that share identical
    characteristics with other printers, in order to save time.
    Programs run under valgrind take many times longer to run than
    normal.

    In addition, in order to successfully use valgrind, you must
    compile with static libraries only (--disable-shared).  If you do
    not do so, you will run valgrind on a small wrapper script rather
    than on the test itself.

    It is a release requirement that all tests pass, with valgrind
    where applicable.  At the present time there is one known
    non-fatal valgrind error (on the Canon iPixma 4000 in grayscale
    mode) and one memory leak associated with that error.  This is
    under investigation and will either be fixed or the requirement be
    waived for this particular issue.

    NOTE TO PACKAGERS: You may wish to distribute the test pattern
    generator in a development package, as it's useful as sample code
    if nothing else.  In addition, there are some tools in the test
    directory that aren't installed that may be of use.  These tools
    are:

    * "parse-escp2" is a Perl script that parses Epson inkjet output
      files.  This is useful as a data gathering tool for reporting
      bugs; the output of this tool is much more compact than the
      actual print file.  "parse-bjc" is a similar script for parsing
      Canon inkjet output files; it is not as well maintained.

    * "unprint" is a tool for reconstituting an image from an Epson
      inkjet output file.  The image is not a true continuous-tone
      image; each pixel is synthesized based on which drops are
      printed.  "pcl-unprint" and "bjc-unprint" are similar tools for
      PCL and Canon output files, respectively.

    None of these tools are versioned.


================================================================

III) GETTING STARTED

    This section describes how to get started using Gutenprint.
    Certain details (particularly for installation and configuration
    of printers) may vary depending upon your operating system.

    Using Gutenprint consists the following steps:

    1) Installing your printer

    2) Configuring desired options

----------------

A) PRINTER INSTALLATION

    The actual procedure to install a printer depends upon your
    operating system and the spooler (printing system) in use on your
    system.

    Gutenprint does not normally require the use of non-standard
    procedures (such as starting special programs) to install
    printers.  Assuming that you are using either CUPS or Foomatic, it
    integrates with your printing system, so the tools provided by
    your distribution vendor should work correctly with Gutenprint.

    Most printing systems currently use PPD files to describe printer
    capabilities.  Some printers are supported by more than one
    driver, so you may find more than one PPD file for your printer.
    Gutenprint PPD files are described as

    Epson Stylus Photo R300 Foomatic/gutenprint-ijs.5.0
    Epson Stylus Photo R300 Foomatic/gutenprint-ijs-simplified.5.0
    Epson Stylus Photo R300 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0
    Epson Stylus Photo R300 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0 Simplified

    The "simplified" PPD files offer a basic set of options only, for
    selecting printer options, standard paper sizes, and basic quality
    settings.  The PPD files that are not "simplified" offer a much
    broader set of controls, giving the user extensive control over
    quality and color adjustment.

    If you are using CUPS, you may be offered a choice between
    CUPS+Gutenprint and Foomatic/gutenprint-ijs PPD files.  While
    either kind of PPD file will work, we recommend using the
    CUPS+Gutenprint PPD files.  These PPD files can be automatically
    updated with cups-genppdupdate.5.0.

    Other PPD files are described differently, such as

    Epson MJ 520C Foomatic/stcolor (recommended)

    These PPD files, whether "recommended" or not, are not Gutenprint
    PPD files.

    NOTES FOR CUPS USERS:

    If you do not choose to automatically update existing PPD files,
    you should reinstall any printers that you are using Gutenprint
    PPD files with.  The Gutenprint driver and the PPD files must be
    kept in sync, since the PPD files reflect the particular version
    of the driver that they were built against.  If you attempt to use
    a version of Gutenprint with PPD files not built for that precise
    version, the driver will fail with a diagnostic error message.
    For example, PPD files built for Gutenprint 5.0.0-beta4 will not
    work with driver version 5.0.0.  You can identify printers using
    Gutenprint PPD files by the name of the PPD file, which will be
    something like:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0(en)

    Linux users please note: If you are using CUPS 1.1.11 or higher,
    and you have a USB-connected printer, you must have a printer
    connected to each USB port that you plan to use and powered on
    when you restart CUPS.  If you do not do so, you will not be able
    to reinstall the printer.  It is only necessary to do this if you
    wish to update PPD files manually; if you use
    cups-genppdupdate.5.0, you do not need to do this.

    Starting with CUPS 1.1.11, you cannot choose an AppSocket
    connection and enter "usb:/dev/usblp0" or the like as the URI; you
    will get a "client-error-not-possible" error at the end of the
    installation process, and you will have a message like the
    following in your CUPS error log (typically
    /var/log/cups/error_log):

E [21/Nov/2001:17:59:07 +0500] add_printer: bad device-uri attribute 'usb:/dev/usb/lp0'!

    If the printer was turned on correctly, you will be given a choice
    of a USB connection in the Device dialog.

    You may also have problems if you have a .lpoptions file that has
    old options set.  If you have problems printing, please remove any
    existing .lpoptions file in your home directory and try printing
    again.


----------------

B) CONFIGURING PRINTER OPTIONS

    Gutenprint offers a variety of printing options, controlling
    printer options, color correction, and quality.  Depending upon
    the application you're printing from and the tools provided by the
    system, they may be organized in various ways.

    The release notes (NEWS) file included with this package describes
    all of the options available, which vary from printer to printer.
    The most important settings are the Basic Printer Options and the
    Basic Output Controls.  The most important options are:

        Page Size

                Select the paper (media) size to print to.

        Double-Sided Printing

                Otherwise known as "duplex" printing, this is offered
                for printers capable of printing on both sides of the
                page (generally laser printers).

        Media Type

                Select the kind of paper or other media being printed
                to.  This enables the printer and driver to be set up
                appropriately for the kind of paper in use.  It is
                important to set this to the kind of paper you are
                printing to; failure to do so will typically yield
                poor results.

        Media Source

                Select the source of the paper or other media.  This
                option is offered with printers that have multiple
                feeds, for example multiple paper bins, manual feed,
                printing directly to a CD, etc.

        Output Type

                This option specifies whether to print in color or
                black and white/grayscale (using only black inks).
                Black and white printing is generally faster than
                color printing, even if the item being printed is
                entirely black and white.  However, printing with only
                black ink may yield a "grainy" appearance.

        Color Correction

                This selects the choice of color correction method
                within Gutenprint.  Normally it is not necessary to
                change this setting from the default, which selects a
                color correction mode appropriate for the document
                being printed.  Other common settings:

                * HIGH ACCURACY: Apply optimum color correction to the
                  output to produce the best color quality.  This
                  corrects the hue, brightness, and saturation
                  (brilliance of color).  This is the normal setting
                  to use for printing photographs or graphics if you
                  are not using any external color management.

                * BRIGHT COLORS: Apply color correction to the output,
                  but generate more brilliant colors in some cases.

                * UNCORRECTED: Do not apply any color correction to
                  the output beyond generating linear output.  This is
                  the best setting to use when utilizing external
                  color management; the high accuracy modes employ
                  correction algorithms that may not work well with
                  color management.

                  NOTE: if you use color management with ColorSync or
                  ICC profiles you should use profiles created with
                  Gutenprint and with the exact settings that you plan
                  to print with.  Profiles provided by the printer
                  vendor are calibrated for the vendor's driver, which
                  may not be identical to Gutenprint's calibration.
                  In addition, profiles created using Gimp-Print 4.2
                  or earlier will generally not perform well with
                  Gutenprint 5.0.

        Image Type

                Specify the option that best describes what you are
                printing.  Your choice here will affect the processing
                of the print job.  Currently available settings
                include:

                * TEXT: Optimize the output for printing black text
                  with no graphics.  This option results in crisp
                  output and is very fast, but will yield very poor
                  results with any color or grayscale graphics.

                * GRAPHICS: Optimize the output for printing color
                  graphics.  This option will generate smooth, bright
                  output.

                * MIXED TEXT AND GRAPHICS: Optimize the output for
                  printing a mixture of text and graphics.

                * PHOTOGRAPH: Optimize the output for printing
                  photographs.  This option will generate smooth
                  tones and high quality colors, but will be slower
                  than the other options.

                * LINE ART: Optimize the output for printing black and
                  white line art with intricate detail.

        Resolution (on printers other than Epson inkjets)

                Select the resolution to print at (dots per inch).  In
                general, higher resolutions produce better quality, at
                the expense of additional time.

                As a general rule of thumb, on laser printers and
                older inkjet printers (made before 1999 or
                thereabouts) resolutions of 300 DPI or thereabouts
                provide draft quality; lower resolutions provide
                economy draft quality and cannot produce solid black.
                Resolutions of 600 or 720 DPI produce good quality
                output; higher resolutions are useful for very high
                quality image or graphic output.  Newer inkjet
                printers, with smaller ink drop sizes, typically
                require higher resolutions to produce acceptable
                output; in some cases even 1440x720 DPI does not
                produce very high quality.

        Print Quality (Epson inkjet printers only)

                Specify the desired output quality using convenient
                presets.  Where this option is available, Gutenprint
                will automatically adjust the printing resolution and
                other options to generate the desired quality.
                Not all printers offer all of these options.
		The most commonly used settings include:

                * ECONOMY: Print very rapidly with a reduced amount of
                  ink.  This option will produce washed out colors and
                  grays and will typically be quite grainy and
                  streaky.

                * DRAFT: Print low quality draft output quickly.  This
                  option will typically produce acceptable output on
                  plain paper, but will typically produce faded and
                  grainy output on high quality papers.

                * STANDARD: Print at a normal quality level for text
                  or text/graphics on plain paper.  This option may
                  also be useful for printing draft copies of
                  photographs on coated inkjet paper, but will not
                  normally yield good results for printing photographs
                  on glossy paper.  This is the default setting, and
                  is a good starting point for text or text/graphics
                  printing.

                * HIGH: Print high quality text or text/graphics on
                  plain paper or inkjet paper.  This option will
                  typically produce good color quality.  This option
                  may also be useful for printing draft copies of
                  photographs on glossy paper.

                * PHOTO: Print photographs on glossy paper.  This may
                  also be used to print very high quality text or
                  graphics on high quality inkjet paper, rivaling
                  laser printer quality.  This is a good starting
                  point for printing photographs on glossy or premium
                  matte papers.

                * SUPER PHOTO: Print photographs on glossy paper with
                  very high quality.  This may also be appropriate for
                  line art with extremely fine detail, for which the
                  required resolution may exceed the capabilities of
                  laser printers.

                * BEST: Print with the best quality available on the
                  printer for the application chosen.  This may be
                  equivalent to one of the other settings; on a very
                  few printers the resolution may exceed that of Super
                  Photo mode.

================================================================

IV) SOLVING PROBLEMS

    While we have attempted to make use of Gutenprint as
    straightforward and trouble-free as possible, we certainly
    recognize that there may be problems with installing and using
    Gutenprint.  In the event of any difficulty, we ask that you take
    the following actions:

    1) Read the release notes (NEWS).

    2) Read the FAQ, in doc/FAQ.html.  Your question may be answered
       there.

    3) Make sure that the paper type and size, and media source, that
       you have selected matches the paper loaded into the printer.
       This is only necessary if the printer attempts to print, but
       does not succeed.  It is a good starting point if quality is
       poor (too dark or too light, wet ink on the paper, etc.).

    4) Reset all settings (particularly the color and quality
       settings) to their defaults.

    5) If you are using CUPS, search /var/log/cups/error_log (which
       may be located elsewhere on some systems) for lines starting
       with 'E' (these lines indicate errors).  Also search for log
       information produced by Gutenprint; all such output lines will
       have "Gutenprint".  These lines may help you solve the problem.

    6) If you are using CUPS, enable debugging output.  This can be
       done by editing /etc/cups/cupsd.conf (which must be done as
       root).  There will be a line in that file:

       LogLevel Info

       which should be changed to

       LogLevel Debug

       This will allow CUPS to produce extensive debugging output.
       You will need to restart CUPS (the exact procedure is
       system-dependent) after doing this.  If you report a problem to
       the Gutenprint team, you will be asked for this information.

    7) There are public forums on Sourceforge dedicated to this
       package.  Please see
       http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=1537 for more
       information.  The Help forum is a good source of information.

    8) If you have a technical support issue that does not appear to
       be a bug in the software, you can use the Tech Support Manager.
       Please see http://sourceforge.net/support/?group_id=1537.

    9) If you have found a clear bug in the package, you may file a
       bug report at http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=1537.

    10) You may send mail to the gimp-print-devel@sourceforge.net
       mailing list.  This is recommended as a last resort only.

================================================================

V) USE OF THE CVS REPOSITORY

    Please read doc/README.maintaining for instructions on how to
    build from the CVS repository.  You will need additional packages
    and tools for this purpose.
