<h1 style="margin-bottom:0em;">Gutenprint 5.2.10-pre1</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top:0em;">released February 17, 2014</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0em;">Software Requirements</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.25em;">
<b>System software:</b> Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.x) or later.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to Gutenprint 5.2.10-pre1, a pre-release of Gutenprint
5.2.10. Please read these release notes carefully.
</p>


<h3 style="margin-bottom:0em;">Important Notes:</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:0.25em; list-style-type:disc;">
	<li><b>The Gutenprint drivers do not support any other functions such as scanning on all-in-one devices. </b></li>
	<li><b>The Mac OS X Gutenprint package download does not contain the PPDs for the supported printers. This significantly reduces the size of the download. All necessary files will be written during installation.</b></li>
	<li><b>For OS X 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) and above, PPD files will be created when you add the printer.</b></li>
	<li><b>For OS X 10.5.x (Leopard) the PPDs are written to your boot drive during the installation process.  This will take some extra time and it may seem that the installation has run into a problem or is hung. For older machines running OS X 10.5, it may take ten to twenty minutes or more. Please be patient.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
Gutenprint evolved from Gimp-Print, which originated as the print facility for the open source GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).  It has matured into an independent suite of printer drivers compatible with most UNIX print spooling systems, such as the CUPS spooler in Mac OS X (10.5 and later).  The Gutenprint drivers provide printing quality for UNIX/Linux that in many cases is equal to or better than proprietary vendor-supplied drivers; they can be used for many of the most demanding printing tasks.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0em;">Installation Notes</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0.25em;">
Once you have finished this installation process you will need to set up your printer(s) before printing. Users that already have a previous version of Gutenprint installed will automatically have their print queues updated to use the updated PPDs.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0em;">Support</h3>
<ol style="margin-top:0.25em; list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Read the <b><a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_FAQ_OS_X.php">FAQ</a></b> and the <b><em>Gutenprint Users Manual</em></b>, located at the root level of the installation disk. Answers to most questions can be found within these documents. </li><li> Check the online <b><a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_FAQ_OS_X.php">Gutenprint OS X FAQ</a></b> for the most up-to-date information.  It is available at the Gutenprint Mac website: <a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php">http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php</a> </li><li> There are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=1537">public forums</a> on Sourceforge dedicated to this package.  Please visit them for more information.  The <B>help</B> forum is a good source of information. </li><li> If you have a technical support issue that does not appear to be a bug in the software and you can't find an answer in the <a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_FAQ_OS_X.php">FAQ</a>, you can use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/support/?group_id=1537">Tech Support Manager</a>. </li><li> If you have found a clear bug in the package, you may file a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=1537&amp;atid=101537">bug report</a>. Please do not file bug reports frivolously, as it wastes everyone's time.  An example of a driver bug is an image being printed at the wrong size or with the wrong colors. If your <a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_Supported_Printers.php">supported printer</a> does not print at all, or prints only garbage, then  most likely your printer queue is simply not configured with the correct driver. Please don't file a bug report for these cases. </li><li> As a last resort only you may send mail to the gimp-print-devel@sourceforge.net mailing list.  The people on this list are busy working to make Gutenprint available to you <B>for free</B>. Please exhaust all other sources of support before you send mail to this list. Please <b>do not</b> post questions to this list that have answers available in the <a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_FAQ_OS_X.php">FAQ</a>!</li></ol>
