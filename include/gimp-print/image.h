/*
 * Abstract data type for interfacing with the image creation program
 * (in this case, the Gimp).
 *
 * The progress_init(), note_progress(), and progress_conclude() members
 * are used to enable the image layer to deliver notification of
 * progress to the user.  It is likely that these functions will be
 * dropped in the future, and if desired must be implemented in
 * get_row().
 *
 * get_appname() should return the name of the application.  This is
 * embedded in the output by some drivers.
 *
 * width() and height() return the dimensions of the image in pixels.
 *
 * init() is used to perform any initialization required by the image
 * layer for the image.  It will be called once per image.  reset() is
 * called to reset the image to the beginning.  It may (in principle)
 * be called multiple times if a page is being printed more than once.
 * The reset() call may be removed in the future.
 *
 * get_appname() should return the name of the application.  This is
 * embedded in the output by some drivers.
 *
 * get_row() transfers the data from the image to the gimp-print
 * library.  It is called from the driver layer.  It should copy WIDTH
 * (as returned by the width() member) pixels of data into the data
 * buffer.  It normally returns STP_IMAGE_STATUS_OK; if something goes wrong,
 * or the application wishes to stop producing any further output
 * (e. g. because the user cancelled the print job), it should return
 * STP_IMAGE_STATUS_ABORT.  This will cause the driver to flush any remaining
 * data to the output.  It will always request rows in monotonically
 * ascending order, but it may skip rows (if, for example, the
 * resolution of the input is higher than the resolution of the
 * output).
